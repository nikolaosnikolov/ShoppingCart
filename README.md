# ShoppingCart
## What is this project?
In this project you see a simulation of a shopping cart that you can restock more products. I have made only the restock because this was asked to be done in my activity. It uses React, Bootstrap, and Strapi. As a result, this project is using a kind of remote database.
## How to run?
You have to take the code in the same structure and create your strapi database from your computer's terminal. Then you just create your data in the data base, and it should work.
## What are some future improvements that I may do?
So, in this project I may put real features of a shopping cart such as removing products from the cart. Also, I would like to make a better styling because I want my projects be friendly to the users.
